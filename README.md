The **Python Code Reviewer** is an interactive web application designed to assist Python developers in improving their code. Built using **Streamlit** and **Google's Gemini AI**, this app acts as an intelligent code review tool that provides feedback on the quality, efficiency, and correctness of Python code.

### Features:
- **AI-Powered Code Review**:
  - Utilizes Google's Gemini AI (via the `google.generativeai` library) to analyze Python code and provide structured feedback.
  - The review includes:
    - **Code Analysis**: A summary of the code's functionality.
    - **Error Detection**: Identification of syntax errors, logical flaws, and potential runtime issues.
    - **Performance Optimization**: Suggestions for improving code performance and efficiency.
    - **Best Practices**: Recommendations on code readability, maintainability, and security.
    - **Final Rating**: An overall score out of 5 based on code quality and correctness.
  
- **User Interface**:
  - The app provides a user-friendly interface via **Streamlit** where users can easily input their Python code into a text area and receive an instant code review.
  - Clear and intuitive design with a **spinner** to indicate when the AI is processing the code review.

- **Error Handling**:
  - Includes built-in error handling to ensure the app remains functional even if an issue occurs while processing the code review.
  - Displays helpful messages to users in case of errors, such as missing API keys or invalid inputs.

- **Instructions and Guidance**:
